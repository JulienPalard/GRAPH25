# CASIO GRAPH 25

Those are programs I restored from my old CASIO GRAPH 25. I wrote them
in 2001, they are probably my very firsts bits of code.


## Fib

Compute the golden ratio by growing the fibonacci sequence


## PI

Just "compute" PI by making the calculator compute `(AÃ—sin (180%A)))`
with bigger and bigger `A`.


## BIN-DEC

A Binary to Decimal and Decimal to Binary converter.


## Diablo

A Diablo like game, with a "graphical" interface, XP, levels, gold,
strength, dexterity, weapons and armors. There's also mobs in the map
but you don't see them, yet you can fight them in a turn by turn
basis. Mobs yield gold, gold permit to upgrade your weapon, armor,
strength and dexterity.

The map has 4 zones of different difficulty.

The calculator did not permit to write to memory during a game, so no
save was possible, so there's a "saving" mecanism giving you 6 numbers
you can re-enter later to restore a saved game. The last one is an
integrity check so users were not able to easily "craft" a backup with
a lot of gold.

My latest backup was a level 147:

- 4457074
- -74111
- 6401565
- 28760645
- -99843
- 2010174747
